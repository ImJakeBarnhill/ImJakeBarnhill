## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jake. I'm a 21 year old college student looking to create an extensive portfolio.

I've got many years of experience, but I have always kept my projects to myself and deleted them after.
Some projects must be kept private, obviously. For those projects, my goal is to create a few public items that can be
shown to anyone, the usage of said item will be kept private.

Lets say I was creating a chess game. If I needed to keep this project, I could potentially create seperate public projects out of it.
For example, I could create a public project that allows you to create a game board and control the pieces. The project has nothing to do
with my original goal of a chess game, so therefore my original project is still secret. I would create the private chess game that uses the
public API, this way I'm getting credit for creating projects while also maintaining anonymity.
